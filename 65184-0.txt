    studies.


ILLUSTRATIVE STORY.

“Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself.” This, my
dear boys, explains all that Daniel did, and all that Daniel became;—this
is the root of the matter, it was this “purpose in his heart,” carried
out, that made him good and great: he purposed in his heart that he
should not sin.

Most boys are fond of laying plans—they have many purposes for the
future. I remember often at school we used to talk of what we would
be, what we would do, when we were men. One would be a sailor, another
a goldsmith, another a pastry cook, and another a soldier. I do think
the boy who purposed to be a pastry cook loved sugar, and the intended
goldsmith was fond of the glitter of gold. Yet, if I recollect aright,
not one of these boys became what he purposed—they never _did_ what they
purposed.

I will mark down three kinds of purposes, and tell a little story for
each.

    1. _A purpose of the head._

    2. _A purpose of the tongue._

    3. _A purpose of the heart._

Henry was the one of my companions who had most purposes in his head. He
was a clever boy, about my own age; but he knew it, and never would exert
himself. He was careless about his lessons, and never used to look at
some of them till he was in the school-room; yet he purposed to gain the
first prize in his class. He did not say much about it, but he evidently
took for granted that it would easily be his. Weeks and months passed
away, and frequently Henry suffered for his carelessness. Boys, who were
not his equals, got and kept ahead of him by their superior application.
The master used to tell Henry that he would regret his negligence; and
then, for a few days, Henry’s talents were applied, and he regained
his place; but it did not last, his indolence prevailed, and again he
relapsed. The session drew to a close. Most of the boys now doubted
whether Henry would come off first. The competitions took place, and each
boy lodged his papers. Henry did exert himself then, but it was too late.
Before the assembled school the names of the successful competitors were
read. Henry’s name stood _third_,—his purpose was not of the heart but
just of the head, and nothing came of it. He _purposed, but he did not
do_.

There was another boy older than Henry at the school, whose purposes
were all on his tongue. You never could be long beside him without
hearing him tell what “he could do.” It did not matter who you were
speaking of, or what they had done, Richard could do more. Little boys,
the first week they were at the academy, looked up to Richard with much
reverence, for they believed what he said of himself, but the second week
they knew him better; for though his tongue spoke of great things, he did
very little; and in a short while longer, they found out that Richard
was a boaster, a vain-bragger, who gave his tongue all the work that his
head, feet, and hands should have done; all his purposes were on his
tongue, but he never performed them.

James Ferrier was very unlike either of these boys; his father was a poor
man; and James was despised by many of the boys, when he came among them,
because his jacket was coarse, and his dress clumsily made. But he cared
not; quietly and calmly he took his seat in the class where Henry was,
and though he had been two years shorter time at Latin than the other
boys of the class, it was he whose name stood first on the list, when
Henry stood third. He had no tutor at home to help him; he had far to
walk to the class; and his time for his lessons was shortened by duties
he had to do at home. Still James succeeded, because he had a purpose in
his heart,—he did not think about it,—he did not speak about his purpose,
but _he did it_!

Which of these three boys was likest Daniel? Which of these boys is
likest to you? _A purpose in the heart_ is like a spring of water; you
may stem it up at one spot, but it will burst out at another,—_it will be
done_! Let the purpose of your heart be that you will not sin, and you
will be great and good too.
