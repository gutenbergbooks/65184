<h2>ILLUSTRATIVE STORY.</h2>

<div class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-d.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Daniel purposed in his heart
that he would not defile himself.”
This, my dear boys,
explains all that Daniel did,
and all that Daniel became;—this is the
root of the matter, it was this “purpose
in his heart,” carried out, that made him
good and great: he purposed in his heart
that he should not sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Most boys are fond of laying plans—they
have many purposes for the future.
I remember often at school we used to
talk of what we would be, what we would
do, when we were men. One would be a
sailor, another a goldsmith, another a
pastry cook, and another a soldier. I do
think the boy who purposed to be a pastry
cook loved sugar, and the intended goldsmith
was fond of the glitter of gold.
Yet, if I recollect aright, not one of these
boys became what he purposed—they
never <em>did</em> what they purposed.</p>

<p>I will mark down three kinds of purposes,
and tell a little story for each.</p>

<p class="extra-indent">1. <i>A purpose of the head.</i></p>

<p class="extra-indent">2. <i>A purpose of the tongue.</i></p>

<p class="extra-indent">3. <i>A purpose of the heart.</i></p>

<p>Henry was the one of my companions
who had most purposes in his head. He
was a clever boy, about my own age; but
he knew it, and never would exert himself.
He was careless about his lessons,
and never used to look at some of them
till he was in the school-room; yet he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
purposed to gain the first prize in his
class. He did not say much about it, but
he evidently took for granted that it would
easily be his. Weeks and months passed
away, and frequently Henry suffered for
his carelessness. Boys, who were not his
equals, got and kept ahead of him by their
superior application. The master used to
tell Henry that he would regret his negligence;
and then, for a few days, Henry’s
talents were applied, and he regained his
place; but it did not last, his indolence
prevailed, and again he relapsed. The
session drew to a close. Most of the boys
now doubted whether Henry would come
off first. The competitions took place,
and each boy lodged his papers. Henry
did exert himself then, but it was too late.
Before the assembled school the names
of the successful competitors were read.
Henry’s name stood <em>third</em>,—his purpose
was not of the heart but just of the head,
and nothing came of it. He <em>purposed,
but he did not do</em>.</p>

<p>There was another boy older than Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
at the school, whose purposes were all on
his tongue. You never could be long beside
him without hearing him tell what
“he could do.” It did not matter who
you were speaking of, or what they had
done, Richard could do more. Little boys,
the first week they were at the academy,
looked up to Richard with much reverence,
for they believed what he said of
himself, but the second week they knew
him better; for though his tongue spoke
of great things, he did very little; and in
a short while longer, they found out that
Richard was a boaster, a vain-bragger,
who gave his tongue all the work that his
head, feet, and hands should have done;
all his purposes were on his tongue, but
he never performed them.</p>

<p>James Ferrier was very unlike either of
these boys; his father was a poor man;
and James was despised by many of the
boys, when he came among them, because
his jacket was coarse, and his dress clumsily
made. But he cared not; quietly and
calmly he took his seat in the class where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Henry was, and though he had been two
years shorter time at Latin than the other
boys of the class, it was he whose name
stood first on the list, when Henry stood
third. He had no tutor at home to help
him; he had far to walk to the class;
and his time for his lessons was shortened
by duties he had to do at home. Still
James succeeded, because he had a purpose
in his heart,—he did not think about
it,—he did not speak about his purpose,
but <em>he did it</em>!</p>

<p>Which of these three boys was likest
Daniel? Which of these boys is likest to
you? <em>A purpose in the heart</em> is like a
spring of water; you may stem it up at
one spot, but it will burst out at another,—<em>it
will be done</em>! Let the purpose of
your heart be that you will not sin, and
you will be great and good too.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
