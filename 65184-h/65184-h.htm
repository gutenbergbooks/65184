<h2>ILLUSTRATIVE STORY.</h2>

<div class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-d.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Daniel purposed in his heart
that he would not defile himself.”
This, my dear boys,
explains all that Daniel did,
and all that Daniel became;—this is the
root of the matter, it was this “purpose
in his heart,” carried out, that made him
good and great: he purposed in his heart
that he should not sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Most boys are fond of laying plans—they
have many purposes for the future.
I remember often at school we used to
talk of what we would be, what we would
do, when we were men. One would be a
sailor, another a goldsmith, another a
pastry cook, and another a soldier. I do
think the boy who purposed to be a pastry
cook loved sugar, and the intended goldsmith
was fond of the glitter of gold.
Yet, if I recollect aright, not one of these
boys became what he purposed—they
never <em>did</em> what they purposed.</p>

<p>I will mark down three kinds of purposes,
and tell a little story for each.</p>

<p class="extra-indent">1. <i>A purpose of the head.</i></p>

<p class="extra-indent">2. <i>A purpose of the tongue.</i></p>

<p class="extra-indent">3. <i>A purpose of the heart.</i></p>

<p>Henry was the one of my companions
who had most purposes in his head. He
was a clever boy, about my own age; but
he knew it, and never would exert himself.
He was careless about his lessons,
and never used to look at some of them
till he was in the school-room; yet he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
purposed to gain the first prize in his
class. He did not say much about it, but
he evidently took for granted that it would
easily be his. Weeks and months passed
away, and frequently Henry suffered for
his carelessness. Boys, who were not his
equals, got and kept ahead of him by their
superior application. The master used to
tell Henry that he would regret his negligence;
and then, for a few days, Henry’s
talents were applied, and he regained his
place; but it did not last, his indolence
prevailed, and again he relapsed. The
session drew to a close. Most of the boys
now doubted whether Henry would come
off first. The competitions took place,
and each boy lodged his papers. Henry
did exert himself then, but it was too late.
Before the assembled school the names
of the successful competitors were read.
Henry’s name stood <em>third</em>,—his purpose
was not of the heart but just of the head,
and nothing came of it. He <em>purposed,
but he did not do</em>.</p>

<p>There was another boy older than Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
at the school, whose purposes were all on
his tongue. You never could be long beside
him without hearing him tell what
“he could do.” It did not matter who
you were speaking of, or what they had
done, Richard could do more. Little boys,
the first week they were at the academy,
looked up to Richard with much reverence,
for they believed what he said of
himself, but the second week they knew
him better; for though his tongue spoke
of great things, he did very little; and in
a short while longer, they found out that
Richard was a boaster, a vain-bragger,
who gave his tongue all the work that his
head, feet, and hands should have done;
all his purposes were on his tongue, but
he never performed them.</p>

<p>James Ferrier was very unlike either of
these boys; his father was a poor man;
and James was despised by many of the
boys, when he came among them, because
his jacket was coarse, and his dress clumsily
made. But he cared not; quietly and
calmly he took his seat in the class where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Henry was, and though he had been two
years shorter time at Latin than the other
boys of the class, it was he whose name
stood first on the list, when Henry stood
third. He had no tutor at home to help
him; he had far to walk to the class;
and his time for his lessons was shortened
by duties he had to do at home. Still
James succeeded, because he had a purpose
in his heart,—he did not think about
it,—he did not speak about his purpose,
but <em>he did it</em>!</p>

<p>Which of these three boys was likest
Daniel? Which of these boys is likest to
you? <em>A purpose in the heart</em> is like a
spring of water; you may stem it up at
one spot, but it will burst out at another,—<em>it
will be done</em>! Let the purpose of
your heart be that you will not sin, and
you will be great and good too.</p>
